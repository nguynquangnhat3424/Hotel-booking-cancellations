# Hotel-booking-cancellations
**Objective**

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning classification model using Python to predict hotel booking cancellations. This proactive approach empowers businesses in the hospitality industry to minimize revenue losses by:

* Identifying reservations with a high likelihood of cancellation.
* Implementing targeted strategies to retain bookings (e.g., offering incentives, flexible cancellation policies).
* Optimizing revenue management through informed decisions on overbooking and pricing.

**Methodology**

The project employs a systematic approach:

* Data Acquisition:

Historical hotel booking data is acquired, ideally containing relevant features such as guest demographics, booking details (dates, lead time, price, cancellation policy), and cancellation status.

* Data Preprocessing:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the data's characteristics, identify missing values, and explore relationships between features.
Data cleaning techniques address inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers that might hinder model performance.
Feature engineering may be applied to create new informative features from existing ones (e.g., combining lead time and cancellation policy to create a risk score).
Data discretization (e.g., binning continuous features) might be necessary depending on the chosen classification algorithm.

* Frequent Pattern Mining:

The FP-Growth algorithm or similar techniques are employed to uncover frequent patterns within the historical data, particularly those associated with cancellations.These patterns provide insights into guest behavior and booking characteristics that often lead to cancellations.

* Machine Learning Model Selection and Training:

Based on data characteristics and project goals, a suitable classification model will be chosen (e.g., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes). The model is trained using the prepared dataset, incorporating frequent patterns as informative features.

* Model Evaluation and Refinement:

The trained model is evaluated using cross-validation or other techniques to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
Hyperparameter tuning is explored to optimize model performance.

**The project aims to achieve:**

Over 70% accuracy in predicting hotel booking cancellations.
A user-friendly and interpretable model that allows businesses to understand the key factors driving cancellation risks.
Actionable insights to improve operational efficiency by proactively preventing cancellations and maximizing revenue.
